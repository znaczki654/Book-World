                 <div id="review">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I Stay follows the story of seventeen year old Mia Hall who is extremely talented at playing the cello and has to make a huge decision: whether to pursue her dreams and go to Julliard and leave her family and her beloved boyfriend, Adam behind or not. However, the story takes a turn for the worst when Mia and her family get into a devastating car crash which immediately kills all of Mia's family apart from Mia, who is in a coma. The rest of the story then follows her out-of-body experience where she has to make the biggest decision of all: to wake up and be reunited with Adam or die and join her family in the afterlife.<br><br>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to admit, this story was immensely devastating but I loved it all the same. What I loved the most was the originality of it; I mean, it takes real talent to really think outside the box like the author has. It really made me wonder what coma patients must be going through while there are in a coma, whether or not they actually know what is going on and whether or not they can decide to wake up. These are all crazy thoughts but I love a book that really makes me think about what I would do if I was in that particular situation. And of course, as I always say 'If a book makes you cry, it is a good book', therefore If I Stay is an excellent read and I would definitely recommend it to those who are looking for a sad yet completely different book.<br><br>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also watched the movie that recently came out and after reading the book, I must say that the book is a lot better because you get to feel a lot closer to the main character and you get a detailed description of what is going on and again, it really makes you think, whilst the movie was just really straightforward (which is great if you're into that, unlike me). However, always remember and I can't stress this enough: NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS MOVIE.<br><br>
                 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally, I would like to finish off by saying that, in all honesty, I feel as though this book is a little better than The Fault In Our Stars, which has been my favourite book since 2013. I would give it five stars out of five because I loved every bit of it.<br><br>
